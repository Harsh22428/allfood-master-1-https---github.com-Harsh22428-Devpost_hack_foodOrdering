Inspiration : 

Student food insecurity significantly impacts well-being and academic performance, leading to poor health, decreased concentration, and lower achievement. Financial constraints force students to choose cheap, unhealthy options, while local vendors offering nutritious, affordable thalis go unnoticed due to limited advertising. Students also lack access to nearby nutritious options like fruit shops and juice bars, essential for a balanced diet. A comprehensive solution is needed: personalized diet charts, daily meal planners, and a directory of nutritious options. By connecting students with local vendors and resources, we can empower them to lead healthy lifestyles, ensuring no student has to choose between education and their next meal.


What it does: 

The Nourishment Hub addresses student food insecurity by connecting students with affordable, nutritious meals. Partnering with local restaurants, dhabas, and shops, we offer budget-friendly thalis available for online purchase or via our interactive map. Our platform includes a directory of nearby nutritious options like fruit shops and juice bars, ensuring access to a variety of healthy food sources. We also provide a daily meal planner tailored to individual dietary needs and personalized diet consultations with custom diet charts.
